This is an online realtime chatting system.
Languages used : PHP, AngularJS, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS3
When user 1 and 2 initiate a conversation, two files are created - 1_2.txt and 2_1.txt
User 1 writes to 1_2.txt but reads from 2_1.txt. The vice versa works for the other user. The only involvement of the database is storing the credentials of the users. Currently, encryption has not been added yet, which is a crusial factor in the security of the system
